Overview:
This project generates unique combinations of numbers between 1 and 9 that sum up to a specified value, constrained by a specific number of terms. It is designed to assist in solving Killer Sudoku puzzles by providing valid number sets for cages.

Features:
Generates all possible combinations of numbers between 1 and 9 that satisfy:
- A target sum (e.g., 15).
- A specific number of terms (e.g., 3).
- Ensures all combinations are unique and comply with Killer Sudoku rules (no repeated numbers in a combination).


This code can be improved by creating a single, versatile function that generates a unique list of n numbers within any specified range that sum to a given value k.
